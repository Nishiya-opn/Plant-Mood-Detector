# PLANT MOOD DETECTOR üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name:Techie Chicas


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nishiya Fathima O P N - Farook college
- Member 1: Jasra Janna P K - Farook college 
### Project Description
The Plant Mood Detector is a fun, interactive, and light-hearted web application that allows users to "detect the mood" of their plants by uploading or capturing a photo. The app uses randomization and visual cues to generate a fictional emotional state for the plant (e.g., Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy) along with humorous care advice.

Though not scientifically accurate, this project is designed to create a playful connection between humans and plants by encouraging engagement through technology.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many plant owners struggle to consistently engage with or care for their plants, often forgetting to check on them regularly. There's a lack of fun, interactive tools that make plant care feel personal and emotionally engaging‚Äîespecially for casual or new plant lovers.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Plant Mood Detector offers a playful and creative way to connect with plants by letting users upload or take a photo and receive a randomly generated "mood" and care advice. This lighthearted interaction encourages more frequent engagement with plants and makes plant care feel fun, emotional, and rewarding.
